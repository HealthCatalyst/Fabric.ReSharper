# Visual Studio Code Shared Styling Configuration

## Purpose ##

These configuration files are primarily for Angular applications developed in Visual Studio Code.

## Recommended Extensions ##

For styling and linting purposes, we use a combination of ESLint and Prettier,
along with minimal configuration files.  The bulk of the linting rules use the built-in recommended lists,
along with rules for using eslint with Prettier.

## Configuration Files ##

.prettierrc and .eslintrc.js are placed in the root of the Angular applications

package.json contains versions of the required packages as of 2021.3.4, along with an npm command to run the linter
